    <h3>Recipe for the best Panko-Crusted Pork Chops</h3>
    <p>These pork chops, prepared in the air fryer, are enhanced by a simple brine. With just a few seasonings in the crust, the chops are tender and juicy, crispy, and just right! Of course you may add more seasonings, if you like, just be careful of hiding the flavor of a simply delicious chop. We enjoyed these pork chops with potatoes in a cheese sauce and oven-roasted asparagus.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>kosher salt</li>
        <li>white sugar</li>
        <li>bay leaf</li>
        <li>pork chops</li>
        <li>bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
